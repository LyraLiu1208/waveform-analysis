# FFT Reconstruction Development Log

## Project Overview
Development of `fft_reconstructor.py` - an advanced FFT-based waveform reconstruction tool for haptic texture analysis using professional signal processing methods.

## Session Date
September 12, 2025

## Initial Requirements
- Create FFT reconstruction script based on existing `waveform_analyzer.py`
- Use 20-400Hz frequency range instead of 3 dominant frequencies
- Implement both phase-preserved and phase-removed reconstruction modes
- Use middle 10s of data with 1s segments for analysis
- Output to `waveform2` directory with C++ array format

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation
**Objective**: Create basic FFT reconstruction functionality
- ✅ Implemented `WaveformReconstructor` class
- ✅ Added 20-400Hz frequency filtering
- ✅ Created dual reconstruction modes (with/without phase)
- ✅ Integrated C++ array output and PNG visualization

### Phase 2: Professional Signal Processing Integration
**Objective**: Implement industry-standard Welch's method
- ✅ Replaced simple FFT with Welch's method for amplitude analysis
- ✅ Used 50% overlap Hanning windows for noise reduction
- ✅ Implemented hybrid approach: Welch amplitudes + first-segment phases
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug output

**Technical Details**:
- Window function: Hanning
- Overlap: 50%
- Scaling: Power spectrum density
- Detrending: Constant (DC removal)

### Phase 3: Debugging Frequency Resolution Issues
**Problem**: Reconstruction showed 1-second periods instead of expected ~40ms periods
**Root Cause**: 1Hz frequency resolution was too coarse for accurate representation

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **High-Resolution Approach** (0.1Hz): Used 10-second segments
   - Result: 3,801 frequency components, very precise but potentially over-complex
   
2. **Medium-Resolution Approach** (1Hz): Used 60-second data span with 1-second windows
   - Result: Better averaging, 381 frequency components
   
3. **Optimized Resolution** (5Hz): Used 0.2-second segments
   - Result: 77 frequency components, eliminated beat frequency issues

### Phase 4: Beat Frequency Problem Resolution
**Problem**: Persistent 1Hz modulation in reconstructed waveforms
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- 24Hz + 25Hz components → 1Hz beat frequency
- 29Hz + 30Hz components → 1Hz beat frequency
- Phase interpolation errors
- Boundary discontinuities

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Phase Interpolation Elimination**: Direct FFT instead of Welch+interpolation
2. **DC Offset Removal**: Explicit mean subtraction
3. **Boundary Continuity**: Period-aligned reconstruction windows
4. **Beat Frequency Mitigation**: 5Hz resolution to avoid close frequency pairs

### Phase 5: Final Optimization
**Breakthrough**: 5Hz frequency resolution
- Eliminates close frequency pairs (no more 24/25Hz conflicts)
- Maintains sufficient precision for texture analysis
- Significantly reduces computational complexity
- Clean frequency separation: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40Hz...

## Technical Specifications

### Final Configuration
```python
analysis_duration = 60.0    # seconds
segment_duration = 0.2      # seconds (for 5Hz resolution)
frequency_range = 20-400    # Hz
target_sampling_rate = 8000 # Hz (for Pico compatibility)
frequency_resolution = 5.0  # Hz
```

### Signal Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load 60-second segment from middle of audio file
   - Apply DC removal and Hanning windowing

2. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - Direct FFT on first 0.2-second segment
   - 5Hz frequency resolution (4,409 total bins)
   - Filter to 20-400Hz range (77 components)

3. **Waveform Reconstruction**:
   - Period-aligned reconstruction (integer number of cycles)
   - Cosine-based synthesis for phase stability
   - Dual modes: phase-preserved and phase-removed
   - int16 scaling for embedded system compatibility

4. **Output Generation**:
   - PNG plots showing 2-second waveforms
   - C++ array files with one-cycle data
   - Comprehensive analysis logging

## Key Achievements

### Performance Metrics
- **Frequency Components**: Reduced from 381 to 77 (80% reduction)

### Technical Innovations
